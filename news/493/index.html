				<p>This report presents data on the cryptocurrency market changes during 2017–2018. Special emphasis has been placed on an analysis of the changes that have taken place in March 2018, including over the last week (March 12–18, 2018).</p>

				<h3>1. General cryptocurrency and digital assets market analysis (by week, month, quarter). Market trends.</h3>
				<h3>1.1 General cryptocurrency and digital assets market analysis (by week, month).</h3>
				<h3>Table 1.1. Trends in capitalization of the cryptocurrency market and main cryptocurrencies from January 1, 2018, to March 18, 2018*</h3>
				<img src="cc-table.jpg" />
				<legend>* Data as of March 18, 2018 (all figures calculated at 03:00 UTC)</legend>
				<legend>** Since December 1, 2017, the ZAK-4 index has been calculated using the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Bitcoin Cash.</legend>
				<legend>*** When calculating the ZAK-8 index, the cryptocurrencies with the largest capitalization are used. At present (March 18, 2018), the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Litecoin, Stellar, and NEO are used to calculate the ZAK-8 index.</legend>
				<legend>Data source: coinmarketcap.com,smithandcrown.com</legend>

				<p>Over the past week cryptocurrency market capitalization fell by another 15%, and equaled $307.7 billion as of 03:00 UTC on March 18, 2018 (see Table 1.1), bringing the drop from the start of the year to 50%, i.e. market capitalization has been halved.</p>

				<p>The Smith + Crown Index for the week decreased from 20,158 to 17,318, with the fall in the index relative to the start of the year equaling more than 10,000.</p>
				<p>The dominance of the four and eight largest cryptocurrencies as of 03:00 UTC on March 18, 2018, equaled 74.3% and 80.9%, respectively, with bitcoin dominance increasing to 43.4% (see Table 1.1), i.e. one can conclude that altcoins have depreciated more significantly since the beginning of March than the leader of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
				<p>The largest changes in cryptocurrency market capitalization took place on March 15 and 18 (fig. 1), due to a number of factors including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>on March 14 information appeared stating that Google, following the lead of Facebook and Instagram, had announced its intention to ban all advertising related to the crypto industry and ICOs to limit the risks for consumers.</li>
					<li>on the eve of the G20 summit (March 19–20), at which the issue of global control over the crypto industry will be considered, capitalization initially fell, but in the evening of March 18 a growth in prices and activity began to be seen for nearly all cryptocurrencies and digital assets (see Table 1.4).</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Figure 1. Cryptocurrency market capitalization since March 12, 2018.</h3>

				<legend>Data source: coinmarketcap.com</legend>

				<p>Overall, during the period from March 12–18, 2018, the price of only 26 of the top 500 cryptocurrencies and digital assets appreciated, resulting in a decline in cryptocurrency market capitalization by more than $50 billion.</p>
				<p>Over the past week the number of cryptocurrencies with a capitalization of more than $1 billion decreased from 22 to 18, with the price of all of them falling (except Tether).</p>
				<p>The coins and tokens from the top 500 that demonstrated the largest growth in prices are given in fig. 2. From the top 100, only the price of Binance Coin (+12.13%) and Nucleus Vision (+2.55%) increased.</p>
				<h3>The growth and fall of cryptocurrency prices over the past week (March 12–18, 2018)</h3>
				<p>The prices of some cryptocurrencies may fluctuate from -50% to +50% over the course of a single day. Therefore, when analyzing cryptocurrency price trends, it is advisable to use their average daily amounts on various cryptoexchanges.</p>
				<p>Below we consider the top 10 cryptocurrencies that demonstrated the most significant change in price over the past week (fig. 2–3). In this regard, only those coins and tokens included in the top 500 and top 100 in terms of market capitalization (according to the data of coinmarketcap.com) were considered.</p>
				<h3>Figure 2. Largest growth in prices over the past week</h3>
				<img src="cc-rates.jpg" />
				<legend>Data source: coinmarketcap.com<br />The change in price was calculated based on average daily data</legend>

				<p>Tables 1.2 and 1.3 show the possible factors or events that could have influenced the fluctuation in prices for certain cryptocurrencies. Table 1.4 shows the possible factors or events that could have influenced the cryptocurrency market in general.</p>

				<h3>Table 1.2. Factors or events that could have led to a growth in cryptocurrency prices over the past week</h3>
				<img src="cc-list.jpg" />
				
				<p>A depreciation in price was seen for 474 coins and tokens of the top 500 cryptocurrencies and digital assets by capitalization over the past week. The ten cryptocurrencies that showed the most noticeable drops in price are shown in fig. 3.</p>

				<h3>Table 1.3. Factors or events that could have led to a fall in cryptocurrency prices over the past week</h3>
				<img src="cc-tokens.jpg" />

				<p>Table 1.4 shows events that took place from March 12–18, 2018, and had an impact on both the prices of the dominant cryptocurrencies and the market in general, with an indication of their nature and type of impact.</p>

				<p>To analyze trading activity on cryptocurrency exchanges, the ZAK-n Crypto index is calculated (see the Glossary). The values of the ZAK-4 Crypto and ZAK-8 Crypto indices are presented in Tables 1.1, 1.5.a, and 1.5.b. In early March the 24-hour trading volumes (Volume 24h) for the four dominant cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple) equaled from $7.7 billion to $12.4 billion (Table 1.5.a).</p>
				<p>The value of the daily ZAK-4 Crypto fluctuated from 2.7% to 4.7%. These are fairly high liquidity numbers, but only approximately half of what they were in January and February, when the index reached 10% (for example, at the time of the downward adjustment of the cryptocurrency market on February 6, 2018).</p>
				<p>This attests to a partial decline in the activity of the dominant cryptocurrencies on the market, which can be attributed primarily to the largely negative tone of the news items aimed at identifying the risks of investment in this industry and the strong impact of regulation being introduced by countries.</p>

				<h3>Table 1.5.a. Daily ZAK-4 Crypto index calculation (from March 1, 2018, to March 18, 2018)</h3>

				<legend>* Data as of March 18, 2018, 00:00 UTC</legend>
				<legend>** Data source: coinmarketcap.com</legend>

				<p>The 24-hour trading volumes (Volume 24h) for the eight dominant cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Litecoin, Stellar, NEO, and Cardano) equaled $11.8 billion by the end of last week (Table 1.5.b), i.e. 4.7% of their market capitalization, which attests to the positive atmosphere and expectations prior to the start of the G20 summit.</p>
				<p>The ZAK-4 Crypto and ZAK-8 Crypto indices are considered in more detail in Tables 1.5.a and 1.5.b.</p>
